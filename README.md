# *Used Materials:*

## integrators:

- LM741CN Op-Amps

## Passive Components:

- 100K , 5.1K , 3.16K, 1.8K, 2.7K and 1K Resistor
- 100K and 10K Potantiemeter
- (!!!Ä°MPORTANT) 1nF Capacitor But this capacitor will not be an electrolyte capacitor. It will be a non-polarised capacitor because I couldn't find the right component. I ordered it without assembly. I will solder the right capacitor.

## Active Components:

- 1N4732A Zener Diodes
- 1N4007G Diodes
- 2N2222Transistor (NPN)
- PN2907 Transistor (PNP)

## Other Components:

- CONNECTOR-TH_3P-P5.00

This is the PCB I designed myself, but I can't be too sure. If there are people who are experts in PCB, they can contact me and tell me the mistakes I made.
